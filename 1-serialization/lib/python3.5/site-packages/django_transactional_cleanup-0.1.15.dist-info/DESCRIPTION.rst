django-transactional-cleanup automatically deletes old file for FileField,
ImageField and subclasses, and it also deletes files on models instance
deletion. This app is based on django-cleanup.

**Warning**: It depends on django-transaction-hooks app and you need to
configure your database backend to use a django-transactional-hooks backend or
any that use the django-transactional-hooks backend mixin. See the
documentation here: https://django-transaction-hooks.readthedocs.org/.
